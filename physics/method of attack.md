**Method of Attack**


An effective method of attack is essential in the solution of dynamics problems, as for all engineering problems. Development of good habits in formulating problems and in representing their solutions will be an invaluable asset. Each solution should proceed with a logical sequence of steps from hypothesis to conclusion. The following sequence of steps is useful in the construction of problem solutions.


1. **Formulate the problem:**
   - State the given data.
   - State the desired result.
   - State your assumptions and approximations.

2. **Develop the solution:**   
   - Draw any needed diagrams, and include coordinates which are appropriate for the problem at hand.
   - State the governing principles to be applied to your solution.
   - Make your calculations.
   - Ensure that your calculations are consistent with the accuracy justified by the data.
   - Be sure that you have used consistent units throughout your calculations.
   - Ensure that your answers are reasonable in terms of magnitudes, directions, common sense, etc.
   - Draw conclusions.

The arrangement of your work should be neat and orderly. This will help your thought process and enable others to understand your work. The discipline of doing orderly work will help you to develop skill in problem formulation and analysis. Problems which seem complicated at first often become clear when you approach them with logic and discipline.
