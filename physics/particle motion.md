A particle is a body whose physical dimensions are so small compared with the radius of curvature of its path that we may treat the motion of the particle as that of a point. 


For example, the wingspan of a jet transport flying between Los Angeles and New York is of no consequence compared with the radius of curvature of its flight path, and thus the treatment of the airplane as a particle or point is an acceptable approximation.
