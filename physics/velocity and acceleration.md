The average velocity of the particle during the interval $\Delta t$ is the displacement divided by the time interval or $\displaystyle{v_{av} = \frac{\Delta s}{\Delta t}}$ becomes smaller approaches zero in the limit, the average velocity approaches the _instantaneous velocity_ of the particle, which is:

$$\begin{align}
	v 
	
	&= \lim_{\Delta t \to 0}{\displaystyle{\frac{\Delta S}{\Delta t}}} 
\end{align}$$

$$\begin{align}
	v 

	= \dfrac{ds}{dt}

	= \dot{s}
\end{align}$$
(Eq 2.1)


Similarly, one can define acceleration of the particle during the interval $\Delta t$ as the change in its velocity divided by the time interval or $a_{av} = \dfrac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}$ .
