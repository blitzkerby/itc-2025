[Michael Penn's Version]
##### **Definition**

We say $f : A \rightarrow ℝ$  is *uniformly continuous* on $A$,
	if for all $\epsilon > 0$ 
	there is a $\delta > 0$  such that for all $a \in A$ 
		if  $\left|{ x - a }\right| < {\delta}$  
		then $\left|{f(x) - f(a) }\right| < \epsilon$
		

*The key difference between uniform continuity and regular (pointwise) continuity is that in uniform continuity, the $\delta$ depends only on $\epsilon$ and not on the specific points $x$ or $y$ in the set $S$.*


In simpler terms, the same $\delta$ works for the entire domain $S$, rather than varying from point to point.
