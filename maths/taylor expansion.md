The Taylor series provides a way to expand a function around a point. 

The formula for the Taylor series of a real function  $f(x)$  about a point  $x = a$  is:

$$
f(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x - a) + \frac{f''(a)}{2!}(x - a)^2 + \frac{f^{(3)}(a)}{3!}(x - a)^3 + \ldots + \frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}(x - a)^n + \ldots
$$
$$f(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \frac{f^{(k)}(x_0)}{k!} \left( x - x_0 \right)^k$$

If  $a = 0$  , this expansion is called a [[Maclaurin]] series.

Taylor's theorem states that any function meeting certain criteria can be expressed as a Taylor series.
