The Maclaurin series is a special case of the Taylor series, where the expansion is centered around $x_0 = 0$. The formula for the Maclaurin series of a function $f(x)$ is:

$$
f(x) = f(0) + f'(0)x + \frac{f''(0)}{2!}x^2 + \frac{f^{(3)}(0)}{3!}x^3 + \ldots + \frac{f^{(n)}(0)}{n!}x^n + \ldots
$$

Alternatively, in summation notation, it is expressed as:

$$
f(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{f^{(k)}(0)}{k!} x^k
$$

This series provides a powerful tool for approximating functions around $x = 0$ and is widely used in mathematical analysis and physics.
