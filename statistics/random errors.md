**Random error** is a chance difference between the observed and true values of something (e.g., a researcher misreading a weighing scale records an incorrect measurement).

Random error isn’t necessarily a mistake, but rather a natural part of measurement. There is always some [variability](https://www.scribbr.com/statistics/variability/) in measurements, even when you measure the same thing repeatedly, because of fluctuations in the environment, the instrument, or your own interpretations.

Random error mainly affects [[precision]]
